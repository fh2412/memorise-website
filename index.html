            <h3 class="title">What is Memorise?</h3>
            Ever go on an amazing trip or experience something unforgettable, only to struggle gathering
            photos from everyone afterwards? Memorise was born out of this exact frustration!
            <br><br>
            I'm Florian, and I created Memorise as a way to easily capture and share all those precious memories in one
            place. It's your personal haven for storing photos, captions, and even dates and locations of those special
            moments.
            <br><br>
            Here's the magic: you can invite friends to join your memories! This means everyone can add their photos,
            write down their favorite parts, and relive the experience together, anytime.
            <br><br>
            Want to find a specific memory? No problem! Search by date, location, or simply browse through the handy map
            view that shows all the places you've created memories. Ô∏è
            <br><br>
            This is just the beginning! Memorise is a personal project fueled by the inspiration of amazing friends like
            you. We're always looking for new ways to improve, so feel free to share your feature ideas! Let's grow
            Memorise together and make sure every beautiful experience is never forgotten.

            <h3 class="title">Why is Memorise in Beta?</h3>
            You might be wondering why Memorise is currently in Beta. As a one-man team (that's
            me, Florian!), building an app takes a lot of time and resources. Before I unleash Memorise on the world, I
            want to make sure it's the absolute best it can be!
            <br><br>
            Here's why Beta is important:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Testing, Testing, 1, 2, 3!</strong> Beta allows me to thoroughly test every corner of the app
                and iron out any wrinkles before a wider release. Think of it like a practice run!</li>
              <li> <strong> Feedback is Gold!</strong> Beta testers like you are invaluable. Your insights and
                suggestions help me shape Memorise into something truly amazing.</li>
              <li> <strong>Building for the Future!</strong> Right now, running Memorise at a large scale would be a bit
                too much for my budget. Beta helps me manage costs while the app is still under development. Those
                storage and server costs will become a breeze once we have a thriving Memorise community!</li>
              <li> <strong>Felxibility is Key!</strong> Beta allows me to make changes and improvements quickly based on
                your feedback. This means the Memorise you experience will be even better when it officially launches!
              </li>
            </ul><br>
            So, being in Beta is not just about me - it's about creating the best possible experience for you and
            everyone who wants to cherish their memories with Memorise. Stay tuned for updates, and thanks for being a
            part of the journey!

            <h3 class="title">The Future of Memorise: It's All About You!</h3>
            Memorise isn't just an app - it's a community in the making. We're on a journey to build a space for
            passionate adventurers like you, a place where you can not only store your memories but also share them, be
            inspired by others, and inspire them in return.
            <br><br>
            Here's a glimpse into what the future holds:
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> <strong>Evolving with You:</strong> User feedback is our guiding light. We'll constantly refine and
                improve existing features based on your suggestions, ensuring Memorise perfectly complements your
                memory-making adventures.</li>
              <li> <strong>A Community of Memory Makers:</strong> We envision a thriving community where you can connect
                with fellow adventurers, share stories, and ignite inspiration for your next unforgettable experience.
              </li>
              <li> <strong>Unleashing Creativity:</strong> We're brimming with ideas for new features! Imagine: in-app
                activity suggestions to spark your adventures, a mobile app for on-the-go memory capturing, a shop for
                Memorise merchandise, in-app challenges to keep things exciting, and even AI-powered caption generation
                to help you perfectly capture the essence of your moments.</li>
              <li> <strong>The Sky's the Limit:</strong> We believe there's no limit to how big Memorise can become.
                Together, we'll shape the future of this platform, ensuring it evolves alongside your desire to explore,
                create, and cherish memories.</li>
            </ul><br>
            Stay tuned for exciting updates! We can't wait to see where this journey takes us and the incredible
            memories we'll create together.
