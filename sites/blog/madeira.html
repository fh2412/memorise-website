                <h2>Stairs on the Trail</h2>
                <p>Sweat dripping, legs burning, we clambered up a seemingly endless staircase carved into the volcanic
                    rock. This was just a taste of the challenges and triumphs that awaited us on our east-to-west
                    Madeira Island crossing adventure with the boys.</p>
                <p>
                    Madeira, a volcanic Portuguese island rising majestically from the Atlantic, is a land of dramatic
                    contrasts. Lush rainforests cling to craggy mountains, while crystal-clear levadas (irrigation
                    channels) snake through the valleys, offering hikers like us a unique way to explore this diverse
                    island paradise. But before we could revel in the breathtaking views, those never-ending stairs had
                    to be conquered – a small taste of the challenges and triumphs that awaited us on this unforgettable
                    trek.
                </p>
                <p>Before we delve into the details of our hike, let's meet the crew!</p>
                <p>First up is <strong class="blog-strong">Niki</strong>, my best buddy from school. We share a thirst
                    for adventure and crack each other up
                    with our shared sense of humor. Always the reliable one, Niki lifts everyone's spirits with his
                    jokes.
                    He tackles long hikes with a full pack without much trouble, though early mornings might be his
                    kryptonite. (And maybe the occasional lack of bathroom facilities!)</p>

                <p><strong class="blog-strong">Jonas</strong>, the newest addition to our crew, joined us through our
                    shared love of tennis (although let's
                    be
                    honest, he's the real athlete – college tennis player and all!). He was our designated navigator, a
                    walking GPS with the route pre-loaded on his watch. Guiding us through (and sometimes, shall we say,
                    interestingly close to) challenging terrain was his domain. However, Jonas also possessed a special
                    talent – the ability to expertly whine about upcoming difficulties based solely on the route info.
                    Blisters on his toes and a hefty backpack provided additional fuel for his playful grumbling. There
                    where phases of the hike where Jonas was dangerously close on giving up, but after all he managed to
                    finish the hike despite some problems.</p>
                <br><img src="../../assets/20240708_202742.jpg" style="border-radius: 15px;"><br><br>

                <p><strong class="blog-strong">Maxi</strong>, my brother, is the undisputed sunshine of the group. You'd
                    be hard-pressed to find anything
                    that dampens his spirits (except maybe...me?). His infectious enthusiasm for everything from
                    sunrises (though he might miss them thanks to his love of sleeping in) to sunsets, and even, shall
                    we say, the "joys" of using the great outdoors as a bathroom, kept us all in high spirits. The
                    simple pleasures – the sea, a delicious tuna lunch (or supper!), a chance to browse a store, meeting
                    new people – all fueled Maxi's excitement. He truly embodied the joy of the journey.
                    Now, Maxi wasn't immune to the physical challenges of the hike. It might have even pushed him to his
                    limits (as long as he could capture a moment for his Instagram story, of course!). But despite the
                    occasional struggle, Maxi never complained and always kept it real with us, which I truly respect.
                </p>
                <p>And then there's me, <strong class="blog-strong">Florian</strong>, the mastermind (or maybe some
                    would say mad scientist) behind these
                    adventurous treks. Like last year's epic Swedish expedition where we went full remote in the Nordic
                    tundra, this Madeira adventure was another one of my crazy ideas hatched to escape the daily grind.
                    At 21, my office job at Siemens Energy was a far cry from mountain peaks and levada trails. Craving
                    a fresh dose of adventure, I started searching for a challenging trek similar to the Kungsleden. And
                    that's how I stumbled upon the breathtaking island of Madeira. Unlike Sweden's well-defined
                    Kungsleden, Madeira offered more freedom in route planning. So, I meticulously charted our course,
                    striving for the most flawless experience possible (although, as you'll see, flawless is a relative
                    term!).</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Island Challenges and Route Planning</h2>
                <p>Unlike our free-roaming Swedish adventure, Madeira presented unique challenges for route planning.
                    Firstly, most of the island is a national park, and wild camping is prohibited in Portugal. This
                    meant relying on designated campsites, which offered a more rustic experience than traditional
                    campgrounds – think fire pits and maybe a water source, but not much else.</p>
                <p>Limited by campsite locations, I meticulously mapped them all using Google My Maps to visualize our
                    options. Next came the research on Madeira's must-see destinations. We aimed to include Ponta do
                    Furado (easternmost point accessible by foot), Ribeiro Frio (charming valley with crystal-clear
                    trout-filled springs), Pico Ruivo (the island's highest peak with breathtaking views), Fanal (known
                    for its otherworldly "white trees"), and Porto Moniz, with its iconic natural sea pools marking the
                    trek's end.</p>
                <p>Connecting these points was exciting – Madeira boasts a vast network of hiking trails, many following
                    the levadas, ingenious irrigation channels transporting water from the rainy north to the drier,
                    agricultural south. However, as we'd discover later, trail maintenance in Madeira isn't always a
                    priority. As long as a path leads somewhere, detours, extra distance, or less scenic routes seem
                    acceptable. But this will be a big topic later in the story, be excited for the challenges it
                    brought to us…</p>
                <br><img src="../../assets/route.PNG" style="border-radius: 15px;"><br><br>
                <p>With a route designed to showcase the island's beauty, utilizing the most captivating trails and
                    incorporating campsites (almost) every night, I finally crunched the numbers. The result? This was
                    no stroll in the park! Over 8,000 meters of elevation gain and a distance exceeding 110 kilometers
                    promised a serious physical challenge. Little did I know, for some of us, the mental challenge would
                    be even greater (stay tuned!).</p>
                <p>With the basic route established, Niki and I tackled the crucial element – food. Unlike Sweden's
                    self-sufficient trek, daily resupply in Madeira seemed feasible. We tweaked the route to incorporate
                    as many restaurants and bars as possible, marking supermarkets along the way for self-catering when
                    needed (think tuna cans and bread – not exactly gourmet!).</p>
                <p>Feeling confident with our meticulous planning, we had one crucial oversight – our water supply. We'd
                    completely neglected that essential detail!</p>

                <br>

                <h2>Day 1: Lisbon Layover Adventure and Eastern Delights</h2>
                <div class="columns is-column-gap-4">
                    <div class="column is-6">
                        <p>Our adventure began even before touching down in Madeira. A 9-hour Lisbon layover presented
                            our first challenge: airport slumber. After some strategic scouting, we discovered a
                            secluded corner with a couple of walls and conveniently located charging stations. Prepared
                            for this unconventional sleep situation, we'd brought our trusty sleeping bags and managed
                            to snatch some precious shut-eye. A rude awakening by the airport cleaning crew simply meant
                            it was time for the final leg to Madeira, where we landed at 9 am.</p>
                        <p>Day one's itinerary called for a relaxed 5km hike, conquering the easternmost points
                            accessible by both bus and foot. With some time to spare before our bus departed, we
                            embarked on a 30-minute walk to the nearest supermarket to stock up on lunch and dinner
                            supplies. The return journey included a pit stop by the sea, our first encounter with
                            Madeira's breathtaking beauty. Refreshed and resupplied, we hopped on the next bus (the only
                            one, boasting a charming 15-minute delay).</p>
                        <p>The €1.40 bus ride itself was an adventure – a 30-minute rollercoaster experience courtesy of
                            our, shall we say, "spirited" driver. His impressive overtaking maneuvers wouldn't have been
                            out of place in a Formula 1 race! Emerging from the bus, we found ourselves in a seemingly
                            deserted, yet oddly touristy, landscape. Our backpacks, clearly geared for more than a
                            casual stroll, attracted a few curious stares.</p>
                        <p>Sunscreen slathered on, we embarked on our inaugural hike. The dramatic cliffs and
                            awe-inspiring scenery were a stark contrast to anything I'd experienced before. Our first
                            campsite was a basic circle of rocks, perfect for pitching our tent. With our temporary home
                            established, we tackled the final stretch to the easternmost point, officially marking the
                            start of our island crossing.</p>
                        <p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, we indulged in a well-deserved swim in the refreshing
                            ocean – a slightly salty mistake considering the lack of post-swim showers. To cap off the
                            day, we enjoyed a classic UNO battle (the first of many!), a testament to the game's
                            timeless appeal. We perched on a rocky outcrop, watching the sun paint the sky in a
                            breathtaking sunset – a nearly romantic moment amidst the wilderness. Exhaustion beckoned,
                            and with a full day ahead, we retreated to our tent, eager to maximize our sleep after the
                            less-than-ideal airport slumber.</p>

                    <div class="column is-6">
                        <p>Day two wasn't exactly a walk in the park. Extracting ourselves from our sleeping bags proved
                            a challenge for some (ahem, Niki!), but the promise of adventure propelled us forward. First
                            things first – a water check. Our supplies were dwindling, but a small town on today's route
                            promised a chance to replenish them.</p>
                        <p>The initial leg of the hike retreaded our familiar path from day one, leading back to the
                            easternmost point. However, a sharp right turn soon marked our departure from the known and
                            our ascent towards our first of three major climbs. The reward for this initial effort was a
                            breathtaking vista overlooking the dramatic cliffs of Madeira. I, armed with my GoPro,
                            declared these views potential contenders for my best footage ever! After a brief summit
                            stop, we descended towards the town, encountering our first minor navigational hiccup. A
                            brief foray into a landscape eerily reminiscent of Mars (in my imagination, at least) was
                            quickly rectified, and we soon found ourselves on a paved road leading to Canical, our
                            salvation for water woes.</p>
                        <p>Fortified by this somewhat underwhelming lunch, we embarked on our second climb. This one
                            dwarfed the first in terms of distance, and for the first time, we pushed ourselves close to
                            our physical limits. The scenery morphed from Martian desert to dry forest as we traversed
                            the cliffs, tackling steep trails that doubled as (supposedly) "easy" 45km trail runs and
                            mountain bike paths. The sheer absurdity of attempting such feats on foot left us
                            questioning our sanity and the sanity of anyone attempting to run or bike this treacherous
                            terrain.</p>
                        <p>Halfway through our 1800-meter climb, our water woes returned. Compounding the problem were
                            two wrong turns that sapped our precious energy and time. Thankfully, Jonas' keen eye
                            spotted both errors early on, preventing major delays. With only one particularly grueling
                            climb remaining, we traversed a relatively flat path along the cliffs. The captivating
                            views, unfortunately, were overshadowed by our desperate thirst. Our eyes scanned the
                            landscape for any sign of water, and our prayers were soon answered – a small, man-made
                            pond. However, closer inspection revealed a multitude of goldfish swimming within – not
                            exactly the ideal drinking source. We filled our bottles anyway, just in case.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="columns is-column-gap-4">
                    <div class="column is-6">
                        <p>Fortunately, a short while later, we stumbled upon a real lifesaver – a small river cascading
                            down the cliffs. Relief washed over us (pun intended). Niki and I desperately refilled our
                            depleted water bottles. Jonas relished a well-deserved break, while Maxi…well, Maxi
                            prioritized a much-needed personal hygiene session. Since he was sharing my tent, this was
                            perfectly acceptable in my book. The rest of us followed suit, indulging in a much-needed
                            cleansing after a day of hiking and no access to showers.</p>
                        <p>Refreshed and (somewhat) revitalized, we tackled the day's final leg – a flat hike along the
                            cliffs, where we finally allowed ourselves to truly appreciate the scenery. This reprieve
                            was short-lived, however, as we faced the final, and steepest, climb of the day. Fatigue
                            weighed heavily on us, necessitating frequent breaks. Our burdened backpacks offered no
                            sympathy.</p>
                        <p>Triumphant after conquering this final obstacle, we arrived at a picnic area that initially
                            seemed like the perfect spot for our not-so-legal wild camping adventure. However, a quick
                            discussion led us to continue onward in search of a more suitable location. A satellite
                            image on Google Maps had revealed a promising little spring, and we set our sights on this
                            potential oasis.</p>
                        <p>Exhausted from the day's grueling 23km trek with 1800 meters of elevation gain, Maxi needed a
                            power gel to muster the strength to continue. Sadly, the spring turned out to be a sheer
                            cliff face devoid of even a single tree. It's worth noting that at this point, we'd ventured
                            inland, leaving the coastal cliffs behind and entering the heart of the Madeiran jungle.
                            Luckily, fortune smiled upon us once more, and we discovered a suitable campsite – a hidden
                            gem nestled within the jungle, offering just enough space for a single tent. With Maxi's
                            energy waning, we opted for this spot despite its limitations. The tent was pitched, my
                            hammock hung (a decision I'd soon come to deeply regret), and a quick meal was devoured.
                            Exhaustion reigned supreme, and after a mandatory round of UNO (of course!), we drifted off
                            to sleep. My initial delight with the hammock, swaying gently within the lush Madeiran
                            jungle (blissfully devoid of the creepy crawlies that plague my nightmares – no snakes, no
                            giant spiders, nothing!), was soon replaced by the harsh reality of its limitations. The
                            sleeping position offered zero blood flow to my legs, transforming a restful slumber into an
                            hourly torture session. Each hour brought a rude awakening, forcing me to contort out of the
                            hammock and dangle my legs precariously to restore circulation. Despite the discomfort, the
                            night held a strange allure, a quiet excitement for the next day's hike, which, in our
                            naivety, we believed would be a breeze. Little did we know, the real adventure was just
                            beginning...</p>

            <h2>Day 3: Trail Closures, Trout Streams, and a Secret Food Stash</h2>
            <div class="columns is-column-gap-4">
                <div class="column is-6">
            <p>Day three dawned in the lush Madeiran jungle, thankfully without a rude awakening from a park ranger (although the lack of feeling in my legs was a concern of its own).  My first order of business was to inquire about the boys' experiences in the tent – after all, this same tent would be our home for the much-anticipated Pico Ruivo camp on day four.  Their positive reports eased my anxieties about a cramped four-person sleep.</p>
            <p>We wasted no time packing up camp, eager to avoid any potential ranger encounters.  The day's route boasted a shorter distance and less elevation gain, fueling our confidence.  The initial leg unfolded leisurely, a gentle path winding through the jungle.  A moderate climb led us to a unique-looking tree, a perfect spot for a break and, of course, a round of UNO!  It seems my luck had finally turned – after a string of losses, victory was finally mine!</p>
            <p>Taking our time, we were overtaken by an Italian couple.  This seemingly insignificant event would soon hold more weight.  After our UNO-fueled rest, we reached an ominous sight – a sign declaring the trail closed.  The Italians, also encountering this obstacle, huddled together, deliberating their next move.  Ever the skeptical Austrians (practically Germans, in some eyes), we refused to believe the closure was legitimate, especially since it meant a significant detour around a mountain we'd rather avoid.  Niki and I embarked on a reconnaissance mission to assess the situation firsthand.  It turns out we weren't the only German/Austrian tourists skeptical of the sign's veracity.  Upon closer inspection, we discovered German scrawled on the sign: "Weg abgerutscht, wirklich kein weiterkommen" – a blunt message translating to "Trail collapsed, really impassable."  This confirmed our suspicions, and with a heavy sigh, we resigned ourselves to conquering yet another mountain – an exhausting prospect.</p>
            <p>Despite our detour, we appeared seasoned enough hikers that the Italians followed our lead.  To our surprise, we managed to rejoin the original trail on the first try – a testament to our rudimentary navigational skills.  The extra mileage, however, ensured that our "easy" hike morphed into something far more challenging.</p>
            <p>Back on track, we traversed a scenic path adorned with crystal-clear mountain streams teeming with trout, a local specialty.  Finally, we arrived in Ribeiro Frio, a charming valley boasting a single restaurant and bar – the only establishments for miles around.  Thankfully, the restaurant was open despite the late hour (past 2 pm).  After days of subpar meals, we seized the opportunity and indulged in a hearty feast.  The waitress' surprise at our collective ravenousness was comical – upon ordering a meal for two, she was met with a chorus of similar orders from the rest of the crew.  Despite her initial concern, I devoured every bite of my double portion (a battle, but a victorious one!).  Naturally, our next stop was the restroom – a real one, a rare and delightful treat after days on the trail.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <br><img src="../../assets/20240710_204747.jpg" style="border-radius: 15px;">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Our previous day's exertions had significantly depleted our supplies.  With a challenging day ahead, we raided the souvenir shop, desperately seeking sustenance.  The shopkeeper, perhaps sensing our hunger rather than our souvenir-hunting desires (our aroma?), revealed a secret stash of food hidden behind a curtain.  Tuna (again) and other lightweight, easily transportable provisions were a lifesaver.  This hidden stock seemed to cater specifically to hikers with the same "live off the land" mentality as us.</p>
            <p>With our food situation secured, we inquired about the restaurant's kitchen closing time (opening hours on Madeira apparently held little meaning).  Learning the kitchen closed at 5 pm, we hurried off to secure a campsite before returning for dinner.  (After my double-person meal, returning hungry was unlikely, but one must maintain their caloric intake!)  The campsite in Ribeiro Frio was idyllic, nestled beside a babbling mountain stream.  A refreshing bath awaited us later, but for now, time was of the essence.</p>
            <p>Initially, it appeared there were more campers than available tent spots.  However, two Czech trekkers (coincidentally with the same island-crossing plan as us) informed us of a hidden gem – a spacious, grassy area just around the corner, perfect for pitching our tents.</p>
            <p>Tents erected and gear stowed, we returned to the restaurant.  The waitress, clearly surprised by our reappearance, was even more astonished by our renewed orders.  Again, she attempted to warn me about my potentially excessive meal choice, but I stood by my decision – the food, despite her reservations, was simply too good.  We enjoyed a pleasant meal, complete with phone charging and, as loyal customers, the privilege of iced drinks (a perk reserved for repeat patrons). Made Madeira's "Brisa," a refreshing local version of Fanta, became our go-to drink, especially considering its affordability (often less than €2).  </p>
            <p>Bellies full and spirits high, we strolled back to camp, gathering our bathing essentials.  A crystal-clear pool fed by the mountain stream awaited us.  First, we tackled the task of cleaning some of our dirtier clothes, followed by our long-awaited showers.  Niki, Maxi, and I, with the uninhibited enthusiasm only a multi-day hike can cultivate, shed our inhibitions and dove into the cool water (much to the amusement of the Czech girls who'd been observing us with a mixture of curiosity and envy).  Jonas, ever the pragmatist, opted for a more clothed bathing experience.  Refreshed and revitalized, we enjoyed the simple pleasure of splashing around and soaking in the cool mountain water.</p>
            <p>As the day drew to a close, the only activity left was our nightly ritual – a round of UNO.  As the cards slapped down and the competitive spirit flared, we recounted the day's adventures, a mix of unexpected detours, hidden food stashes, and refreshing swims.  Day three, with its challenges and triumphs, had solidified our bond and fueled our collective excitement for the upcoming ascent of Pico Ruivo, Madeira's highest peak.  Little did we know, however, that this iconic climb would test our limits in ways we never imagined.</p>
            <br>

            <h2>Day 4: Hiking to the Top. A Day of Challenges and Triumphs in Madeira</h2>
            <p>Day four dawned, promising to be our most challenging yet. Little did we know, the adventure would begin even before we hit the trail. Our campsite conveniently located just five minutes from the previous day's restaurant (and, crucially, the nearest restroom), presented Niki with a near-disaster after the previous day's celebratory feast. We scrambled to pack up camp, transforming into a sprinting human centipede on the five-minute dash to the restroom. Thankfully, a potential catastrophe was narrowly averted. (Let's just say Niki experienced some questionable culinary consequences already the day before. There may, or may not have been, a tense underwear inspection involving a particularly risky fart.)</p>
            <p>With bellies grumbling from skipping breakfast (a strategy that usually helped us break down the trail into manageable chunks), we set off to find the day's path. Little did we know, this climb wouldn't just test our legs – it had a few surprises in store. The ascent towards one of Madeira's higher peaks loomed ahead, promising a day that would be as exhilarating as it was challenging.</p>
            <p>The climb began with a vengeance. The trail, originally designed for downhill mountain bikes, transformed into a punishing uphill slog. We fell into a silent rhythm, each focused on pushing ourselves forward.  Little did we realize, this relentless ascent was pushing one of us to the brink.</p>
            <p>Jonas, with his knowledge of the route, understood the challenge that lay ahead better than the rest of us.  But the lack of breakfast, the ever-steepening path, and the feeling that the others were breezing through (even if that wasn't entirely true) began to wear him down.  His mental state deteriorated, and without us noticing, he neared a breakdown.</p>
            <p>Jonas battled on for a while, but the warning signs were finally clear. I noticed his struggle, and we called a much-needed break mid-climb. Breakfast, long-ignored, became a priority. As we fueled our bodies, Jonas confessed – this wasn't just fatigue. He was on the verge of quitting, a rare admission from someone known for his grit. We took our time, letting Jonas mentally and physically recharge. Finally, with renewed determination, we tackled the climb once more.</p>
            <p>The path narrowed, demanding more focus. Instead of battling exhaustion, we were now navigating a maze of plants, pushing aside branches and ducking under low-hanging foliage. This unexpected shift, strangely enough, proved to be a welcome distraction. Lost in the task of navigating the plant maze, the climb itself seemed to become easier. Before we knew it, we emerged from the green gauntlet into a more open area. The sight that greeted us was a surprise – Pico Airo, our next checkpoint, seemed tantalizingly close. Our gazes fixed on the iconic star-watching building at the summit, we all missed a crucial detail lurking on the path ahead – a hidden challenge waiting for its next unsuspecting victim.</p>
            <p>Lush ferns were replaced by what seemed like harmless greenery. Relief washed over us – this looked like the easiest stretch yet.  Pico Airo, our next checkpoint, beckoned in the distance.  Elated, we started the climb, only to be met with a sharp – ouch!</p>
            <p>Hidden among the seemingly innocuous plants lurked a devilish adversary – a spiky plant with a surprising sting. We underestimated it at first, thinking a little dodging would suffice. After all, the stings weren't unbearable, right? Wrong. As we ascended, the spiky plants became more and more abundant, transforming the path into a gauntlet. The narrowness made avoiding them impossible, and the stings, though initially tolerable, turned into a constant, nagging pain with each step.  What started as a promising final ascent became a march through a botanical torture chamber.</p>
            <p>For Niki, however, the situation was far worse.  His initial complaints, initially dismissed in the face of the shared annoyance, intensified. A quick check revealed the culprit – a severe allergy to the spiky plant's venom.  Panic threatened to set in – we were in the middle of the climb, with no easy way back.  But giving up wasn't an option. Gritting his teeth, Niki joined us as we pushed forward, now battling not just the relentless climb but the constant, burning pain of the stings.</p>
            <p>As if things couldn't get worse, blackberry bushes joined the fray.  These prickly behemoths added a new dimension to the assault, turning our legs into pincushions and making every step a full-body experience.  But we were determined.  There was no turning back.  Finally, with a surge of relief, we reached the top of the plateau.  There, a lifesaver awaited – a levada (water channel) where we could wash our wounds and find a moment of solace.  After a short break, we were ready to face the final ascent to Pico Airo, battered but unbroken.</p>
            <p>The final ascent wasn't a cakewalk – the relentless sun beat down mercilessly, and the steep climb tested our already taxed legs. But at least it was a straightforward hike – no more surprise botanical warfare. We trudged towards the peak, pushing our bodies to the limit. Finally, with a triumphant groan, we reached the summit.</p>
            <p>Except, it wasn't quite the solitary victory we envisioned.  Fifteen minutes before the peak, a vast parking lot materialized, disgorging a sea of well-dressed tourists embarking on their own – very short – hike to a conveniently located cafe. Here we were, four weary backpack-laden warriors, amidst a sea of tourists sporting nothing more than sunglasses and flip-flops.</p>
            <p>The cafe, while not a culinary masterpiece, offered a much-needed respite. We refilled our water bottles and indulged in a well-deserved pizza lunch. Despite the exhaustion and the lingering sting of botanical warfare, a sliver of optimism remained. After all, we'd conquered the seemingly impossible climb – surely the rest of the day would be a breeze, right?</p>
            <p>That optimism evaporated faster than a snowflake in Madeira's summer sun. Our confidence, fueled by the perceived difficulty of the day's earlier trek, was shattered within five steps. A breathless German woman, seemingly on the verge of collapse, stopped us dead in our tracks. After patiently explaining our route (apparently, our backpacks and Austrian flag patch weren't clear enough), we received the obligatory praise for undertaking such a challenge. Then came the warning – a gentle reminder that the hike ahead was no walk in the park, but with unwavering confidence (hers, not necessarily ours), she assured us we'd prevail.</p>
            <p>We scoffed at the German woman's warning.  The initial leg of the hike was a breeze – a seemingly endless descent down the famous "Stairway to Heaven."  Unlike the tourist hordes struggling their way back up, we were the only ones tackling the steps in this direction.  But the triumphant smiles on our faces slowly morphed into concern as we passed these weary souls.  Some looked utterly defeated, their legs threatening to buckle with every step.  Perhaps the woman had a point after all.</p>
            <div class="columns is-column-gap-4">
                <div class="column is-6">
            <p>The seemingly endless staircase continued, each step down a promise of a future climb back up (after all, we were aiming for the highest peak!). The breathtaking views offered little solace to Jonas, whose fear of heights started to gnaw at him. Thankfully, the stunning landscape provided enough distraction to keep him going.</p>
            <p>This pleasant, scenic descent was about to morph into a battle in the final kilometers.  Niki and Jonas fueled up with their energy gels, bracing themselves for the dreaded climb.  As it turned out, the ascent wasn't as bad as anticipated. We even managed a friendly chat with some American hikers, marveling (as they did) at the unusual nature of our vacation.  Despite the physical exertion, the ever-nearing peak spurred us forward.</p>
            <p>Earlier than expected, we reached the mountain hut on Pico Ruivo, immediately refilling our water bottles.  This proved to be a wise decision – the caretaker later inexplicably shut off the water source, forcing thirsty hikers to buy overpriced bottled water.  Lady Luck once again smiled upon us.</p>
            <p>Speaking of luck, securing a spot at the coveted Pico Ruivo campsite felt like winning the lottery.  These spots were limited, and we only managed to snag one tent – officially only usable until midnight.  This cramped situation necessitated some serious cuddling (perhaps a bit too much).  Initially unsure how strictly the permit system was enforced, we were surprised to find two tents already pitched upon arrival (one definitely an imposter, since we had the second permit).  Luckily, a couple of prime, flat spots remained.  We wasted no time setting up camp before embarking on the final push to the actual summit.</p>
            
            <p>Reaching the peak just in time, we enjoyed a few rounds of UNO before the sun dipped below the horizon.  This sunset, a major Madeira attraction, drew in a crowd.  Having claimed the prime viewing spot (thanks to our early arrival), we settled in for a truly magnificent spectacle.  Watching the sun melt into the foreign yet strangely familiar landscape felt almost trance-like, a fitting end to a day filled with adventure.</p>
            <p>Even after the sunset faded, we lingered, savoring the tranquil moment.  As reality slowly seeped back in, we descended back to our tents, only to discover a sea of additional tents sprouting up around us.  Unfazed, we brushed our teeth, cleaned our weary legs, and drifted off to sleep, concluding a day filled with adventure and ending in the most peaceful way imaginable.</p>
